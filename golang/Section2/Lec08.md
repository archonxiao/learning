## How do we run the code in our project?

### Go CLI
1. go build     - Compiles a bunch of go source code files
2. go run       - Compiles and executes one or two files
3. go fmt       - Formats all the code in each file in the current directory
4. go install   - Compiles and "installs" a package
5. go get       - Downloads the raw source code of someone else's package
6. go test      - Runs any tests associated with the current project
